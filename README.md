# Hotel-Booking

The Hotel Booking analysis is based in a compreehensive collection of information regarding hotel bookings, cancellations and guests' details.
The dataset includes information about reservation status, that covers whether a booking was canceled or not, the lead time between booking date and arrival date.

The data set was downloaded from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/hotel-bookings-analysis).

With this project I wanted to perform some analysis and develop my skills in Machine Learning (Supervised and Unsupervised models) using Python, also I continuing developing my skills in Tableau and created a Story with the analysis about the cancelations.
